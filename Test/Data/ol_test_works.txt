The first of these is a series of essays, most of them historical in nature, intended to paint in large strokes the State\u2019s development and to furnish a background against which the detailed information that follows may become more intelligible. The second section describes the State\u2019s nine largest cities. Here the histories of the cities are briefly sketched and their points of interest described for the traveller who wishes to look about him. The third section is a series of selected tours covering the main highways.\u201d"}, "links": [{"url": "http://www.envisionthepast.com/wisconsin-explorers-travelers/", "type": {"key": "/type/link"}, "title": "Wisconsin History: Explorers & Travelers"}], "title": "Wisconsin", "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2009-12-11T04:05:38.511599"}, "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2014-06-23T12:54:30.190585"}, "subject_places": ["Wisconsin"], "subjects": ["Guidebooks", "Description and travel"], "latest_revision": 3, "key": "/works/OL11134546W", "authors": [{"type": {"key": "/type/author_role"}, "author": {"key": "/authors/OL4648791A"}}], "type": {"key": "/type/work"}, "revision": 3}

He recognizes two separate steps in the creation of a layout. Fist, there must be an idea--a selling idea for the particular problem at hand; second, the visualizer must be so trained in design and reader psychology that he can put that idea into planned form that will attract the reader's eye.\r\n\r\nBy illustrating specific layout principles on nearly every page, the author has made it possible to comprehend each type of layout technique from poster and billboard to magazine, newspaper and direct mail. The chapters range from the basic principles of layout design to the functions of an agency art director, including valuable instruction in typography and lettering, continuity in style, bleed space, balance, unity, contrast and art work. Full-color illustrations appear throughout the chapter treating color process and color in layout.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations are designed by five of the most successful advertising men in America. Many of them ar the original layouts of famous advertisements, reproduced directly from the visualizer's drawing board. Together with the thorough yet concise text, they form a comprehensive exposition of the conception and technique of advertising layout.\r\n--jacket"}, "title": "Advertising Layout", "covers": [8595427], "subjects": ["Advertising layout and typography", "Commercial art"], "key": "/works/OL11234723W", "authors": [{"type": {"key": "/type/author_role"}, "author": {"key": "/authors/OL6625877A"}}], "excerpts": [{"comment": "first sentence", "excerpt": "Every advertisement that appears in print has to be planned in its physical format.", "author": {"key": "/people/seabelis"}}], "type": {"key": "/type/work"}, "first_publish_date": "1946", "latest_revision": 6, "revision": 6, "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2009-12-11T04:17:02.181081"}, "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2022-07-11T19:03:22.946334"}}
