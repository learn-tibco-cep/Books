It contains rich analysis of how sustainability is being factored into industries across the globe, with enlightening case studies of businesses serving as agents of change. Contributing authors provide a groundbreaking body of research-based knowledge. They explain that the concept of sustainability is being re-framed to be positive about business instead of being tied to the old notion of a trade-off between business and society (that is, if business wins, society and the environment must lose), and they explore how economic development can contribute to building our common future.", "links": [{"url": "http://www.berkshirepublishing.com/home/product.aspx?projid=79", "type": {"key": "/type/link"}, "title": "book page on publisher's website"}], "title": "Berkshire Encyclopedia of Sustainabilitiy Vol. 2", "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2009-12-11T01:42:22.462455"}, "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2014-07-29T08:55:36.559345"}, "covers": [7247536, 6388506], "subjects": ["business", "sustainability", "encyclopedia", "berkshire", "publishing", "Sustainability", "Environmental quality", "Environmental protection", "Encyclopedias", "Sustainable development"], "latest_revision": 6, "key": "/works/OL9896634W", "authors": [{"type": {"key": "/type/author_role"}, "author": {"key": "/authors/OL3033089A"}}], "type": {"key": "/type/work"}, "revision": 6}
